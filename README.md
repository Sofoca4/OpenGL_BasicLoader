# OpenGL_BasicLoader
A really Basic loader, there is lot of code that must be fixed but it will show you the main code structure.

These files are just code and you must have the respective DLC to run the progran.

Compile file is attached and it works using g++.

This progam works loading an .obj file exported from blender using only faces and vertices.

Program made to only read untitled1.obj but it could be changed properly in opengl.cpp line 55.
